You might have to grant yourself "Storage" permissions, if you dont then you won't be able to use "Choose Manually" feature, use "Load File" then.
*Files for "Load File" need to be in /data/data/cs.b07.cscb07courseproject/files
*Files for "Select Manually" can be anywhere in /storage/sdcard/ (Press Show SD Card in upper left corner menu to see directories)
